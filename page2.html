                            <p> The Book Thief narrator was my favorite part. Never thought I would read from Death's persepctive. I recommend this book to those that have not read this book yet.</p>

    <h2>Annexed by Sharon Dogar</h2>
    <h5>Published September 1, 2010</h5>
    <img src="imgs/annexed.jpg" alt="" style="width:30%;height:400px;">
    <p>Summary</p>
    <p>In this powerful and gripping novel, Sharon Dogar explores what this might have been like from Peter's point of view. What was it like to be forced into hiding with Anne Frank, first to hate her and then to find yourself falling in love with her? Especially with your parents and her parents all watching almost everything you do together. To know you're being written about in Anne's diary, day after day? What's it like to start questioning your religion, wondering why simply being Jewish inspires such hatred and persecution? Or to just sit and wait and watch while others die, and wish you were fighting.</p>
